This is the Duel Masters OCG Definition for OCTGN, and images.

If you want to help out in adding sets/images:
- Fork the repo
- Add the set folder inside GameDatabase/bb784fc6-fe21-4603-90d7-82c049908a74/Sets/
- Make a set.xml file inside
- Fill up the data inside in the same format as other set.xml files
- Each set, booster pack and card needs its own GUID. You can generate GUIDs on websites like this: https://www.guidgenerator.com/
- Inside image database, the folders should contain images named to their card IDs.
- If you have netBeans/java, you can use the extraction programs to quickly get card data and images in a compatible format, but it will require cleaning up later as the program sometimes can't deal with uniques cases on wikia set/card pages.

Note: All images must be 560 px or less in height, and must be in jpg format.

All automations are based on python. OCTGN plugin dev refernce:
